# CURATE Extraction Analysis & Issues

## Executive Summary

**Current Assessment Score: 150 / 1000**

The JSON extraction system has fundamental flaws that make it largely unusable for the intended Comuneo Cockpit application. While it successfully extracts some raw text from PDFs, it completely fails to model the relationships and attributes essential for the cockpit interface.

The previous assessment of 940/1000 was based on viewing the JSON as a standalone structured document. However, understanding the target application reveals that the current structure is fundamentally wrong for the intended use case.

## Critical Issue #1: Attribution Mechanism Failures

The automated process of linking projects to their sources has produced clear, significant errors. The issue is not one of subtle interpretation, but of direct contradiction or complete irrelevance.

### Problem: Source Quotes Are Completely Unrelated to Projects

**Example 1: Altstadt als Identifikationsort**
- Project: "Erhaltung der Altstadt"
- **ERROR**: Source quote is simply "Mobilitätsstruktur."
- **Issue**: Single, unrelated word that does not support the project's theme of preserving the old town

**Example 2: Wirtschaftliche Perspektiven**
- Project: "Langfristige Sicherung der wirtschaftlichen Grundlagen"
- **ERROR**: Source on page 40 is "• Bestehende Freiraumversorgung sichern und ausbauen"
- **Issue**: Quote is about securing green spaces, not strengthening economic foundations

**Example 3: Sozialer Zusammenhalt**
- Project: "Bildung, soziale Teilhabe und Lebensperspektiven"
- **ERROR**: Source on page 7 is about "CO2-Emissionen" and "Ressourcen ver­ braucht"
- **Issue**: Entirely unrelated to social cohesion and education

**Example 4: Biodiversitätsschutz**
- Project: "Naturschutzfachlicher Ausgleich"
- **ERROR**: Source quote is "Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen um 65 Prozent | Basisjahr 1990"
- **Issue**: About climate change goals, not biodiversity offsets

### Problem: Source Quotes from Document Metadata, Not Content

The system mistakenly extracts text from non-content parts of the document (credits, section titles) and presents them as evidence.

**Example 1: Digitalisierung**
- Project: "Digitalisierung vorantreiben"
- **ERROR**: Source on page 7 is "Gestaltung: Ibañez Design, Regensburg"
- **Issue**: Clearly from document credits/impressum with no informational value
- **Note**: Same error repeated for project "Innenentwicklung und Verdichtung"

**Example 2: Dienstleistungs- und Technologieachse**
- Project: "Stärkung der Dienstleistungs- und Technologieachse"
- **ERROR**: Source on page 35 is "ABSCHNITT: Handlungsfelder der Stadtentwicklung | Die grüne und resiliente Stadt"
- **Issue**: Section header, not content that supports the project
- **Note**: Error repeated for other projects

**Root Cause**: Attribution mechanism grabs nearby text or text from incorrect document sections without semantic verification, representing fundamental failure in source-validation pipeline.

---

## Critical Issue #2: Content Quality Problems

### Problem: Thematic Redundancy and Data Fragmentation

The model cannot consolidate related topics, creating multiple categories and projects for identical or heavily overlapping concepts.

**Duplicate Action Fields Example:**
The data contains numerous redundant action_field categories that should be merged:
- Quartiersentwicklung
- Siedlungs- und Quartiersentwicklung
- Raumstruktur, Städtebau, Baukultur und Quartiersentwicklung
- Attraktive Quartiere
- Lebenswerte Quartiere mit hoher Qualität

**Duplicate Projects Example:**
Project "Klimaschutz und Klimaanpassung" (with 20 measures and 6 indicators) appears identically under both:
- Klimaschutz action field
- Raumstruktur, Städtebau, Baukultur und Quartiersentwicklung action field
**Issue**: Blatant data duplication error

**Fragmented Concepts Example:**
Topic "Innenentwicklung" (infill development) is split between:
- Project "Innenentwicklung"
- Separate action field "Innenentwicklung und Verdichtung"
**Issue**: Prevents unified view of the topic

### Problem: Poor Semantic Distinction

Model struggles to understand meaning and function of extracted text, leading to logically flawed content.

**Measures Are Not Actions Example:**
- Project: "Erhaltung der Altstadt"
- "Measure": "Strukturelle Veränderungen in Mobilität und Klimawandel"
- **ERROR**: This is a challenge/context, not a measure
- **Correct**: Measure should describe how to respond to these changes

**Indicators Are Not Metrics Example:**
- Project: "Klimafreundliche Quartiersentwicklung"
- "Indicator": "Klimaschutzziele der Stadt Regensburg"
- **ERROR**: This is the goal itself, not an indicator of progress
- **Correct**: Proper indicator would be specific metric like "CO2 emissions per capita in new developments"
- **Note**: Error repeated across multiple climate-related projects

**Lack of Summarization Example:**
The 20 measures for "Klimaschutz und Klimaanpassung" include both:
- Broad goals: "Modal Split zugunsten des Umweltverbunds ändern"
- Specific actions: "ÖPNV und Radwege ausbauen"
**Issue**: Same flat list indicates failure to grasp hierarchical relationships

---

## Critical Issue #3: Structural Schema Problems

The JSON schema is too simplistic for the data it represents. It captures basic hierarchy but fails to model essential relationships and attributes, causing critical loss of information and context.

### Problem: Flat Arrays for Measures and Indicators

**Most significant structural weakness**: Using simple array of strings prevents capturing crucial information.

**No Linkage Issue:**
- Cannot determine if specific measure achieves specific indicator
- Example: In "Bürgerbeteiligung" project, does measure "Online-Dialog" correspond to indicator "27 % Rücklauf der Bürgerbefragung"?
- Structure cannot answer this - they're disconnected lists

**No Data Typing Issue:**
- Cannot differentiate between qualitative goal and quantitative KPI
- Indicator "Lebensqualität in Regensburg" is high-level concept
- Indicator "27 % Rücklauf der Bürgerbefragung" is specific, measurable metric
- Flat string array treats them identically, preventing meaningful analysis

**No Room for Detail Issue:**
- Robust schema would allow attributes like:
  - `unit: "%"`
  - `target_value: 27`
  - `type: "qualitative"`
- Impossible with current structure

### Problem: Ambiguous Placement of Sources

Sources array attached at project level creates ambiguity:
- Does source quote support project title?
- A specific measure?
- A specific indicator?
- All of them?

**Issue**: Highly unlikely single quote supports entire project with multiple measures and indicators.
**Solution**: More accurate structure would attach source directly to specific claim it substantiates.

**Example**: Quote about "Nachverdichtung" (densification) should attach to that specific measure, not parent "Innenentwicklung" project as whole.

### Problem: action_field Promotes Duplication

**Structural Issue**: Using single string for action_field forces duplication of entire project if it logically belongs to multiple categories.

**More Efficient Structure**: Array of tags/categories for each project allows:
- Project defined only once
- Association with multiple action fields
- No duplication of entire data blocks

---

## The Real Problem: Misunderstanding the Target Application

### Current Approach: "Russian Doll" Nesting (WRONG)

Our process creates nested structure like Russian dolls:
- Action Field contains Project
- Project contains list of Measures and list of Indicators

### Comuneo Cockpit Reality: Peer Relationships (CORRECT)

The cockpit UI clearly shows:
- **Projects and Measures are peers** - appear in same lists, both linked to Action Field
- **Measure is not inside project** - it's distinct item that can be assigned to project
- **This is critical structural error**

### We Treat Rich Objects as Simple Labels

**Current Wrong Approach**: "Indicator" as just name (string of text)
**Cockpit Reality**: Indicator is rich object with properties:
- Trend (Positive, Negative, Stabil)
- Fortschritt (Progress %)

**Same Issue with Action Fields (Handlungsfelder)**:
- **Current**: Simple category labels
- **Cockpit**: Exist in parent-child hierarchy ("übergeordnet" and "untergeordnet")

**Result**: We extract names but throw away valuable data and relationships.

### We Miss the Most Important Connections

The "Maßnahme bearbeiten" (Edit Measure) screen shows true system value lies in connections:

**Essential Links We're Missing:**
- Measure "zahlt ein auf" (contributes to) specific Indicators
- Measure "zahlt ein auf" (contributes to) specific Action Fields  
- Measure can be assigned to Project

**Current Result**: Items in separate boxes but no lines between them that give data meaning and power.

---

## Recommended Solution Approach

### Step 1: Think in Four Separate Buckets

**Instead of**: One big nested structure
**Use**: Four separate buckets:
- Bucket for Handlungsfelder (Action Fields)
- Bucket for Projekte (Projects)  
- Bucket for Maßnahmen (Measures)
- Bucket for Indikatoren (Indicators)

**AI's First Job**: Read PDF and correctly place every relevant piece of information into one of these four buckets.

### Step 2: Define What Each Item Looks Like

**Indicator Item Structure:**
- Not just name
- Should have spaces for: Name, Trend, Fortschritt
- Initially AI might only find name in PDF (okay - other fields filled later in cockpit)

**Maßnahme Item Structure:**
- Name
- Beschreibung (description)
- Budget
- Verantwortliche Person (person responsible)
- etc.

**Handlungsfeld Item Structure:**
- Needs to know if parent or child of another Handlungsfeld

### Step 3: Focus on Building the Bridges (MOST CRITICAL)

After AI sorts information into four buckets, **main job is figuring out connections** between buckets.

**For Every Maßnahme, AI Must Determine:**
- Based on text, which Indikator(en) does this measure affect?
- Which Handlungsfeld(er) does it belong to?
- Is it part of specific Projekt?

### Final Output Structure

**Should NOT be**: One giant nested file
**Should be**: Four distinct lists of items, with each item containing links to items in other lists

**Result**: Structure maps directly to what Comuneo Cockpit needs to function correctly.

---

## Action Items for Fixing the System

1. **Redesign JSON Schema**
   - Create four separate entity types
   - Add rich properties for each entity type
   - Implement relationship/linking structure

2. **Fix Attribution Pipeline**
   - Add semantic verification for source quotes
   - Filter out document metadata and headers
   - Ensure sources directly support specific claims

3. **Improve Content Consolidation**
   - Add deduplication logic for similar action fields
   - Prevent identical project extraction across multiple fields
   - Implement semantic grouping for related concepts

4. **Enhance Semantic Understanding**
   - Train model to distinguish between challenges and measures
   - Improve indicator recognition (metrics vs goals)
   - Add hierarchical relationship detection

5. **Test Against Target Application**
   - Validate output structure matches Comuneo Cockpit requirements
   - Ensure all necessary entity properties are captured
   - Verify relationship mappings work in target interface

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

The current extraction pipeline in `src/extraction/structure_extractor.py` needs fundamental restructuring to address these issues. The multi-stage approach should be redesigned to:

1. **Entity Recognition Phase**: Identify and classify all entities into four buckets
2. **Property Extraction Phase**: Extract rich properties for each identified entity
3. **Relationship Mapping Phase**: Determine connections between entities
4. **Validation Phase**: Semantic verification of sources and content quality
5. **Deduplication Phase**: Consolidate similar entities and prevent redundancy

The current Pydantic schemas in `src/core/schemas.py` are fundamentally incompatible with the target application requirements and need complete redesign based on the Comuneo Cockpit data model.

---

## Final Business Context: The "Bridge Problem"

### Master Challenge Definition

The core task is not just to extract data, but to intelligently transform messy, diverse source documents (PDFs, customer Excel files) into the clean, structured format required by the Comuneo platform.

**The "Bridge Problem":**
- **Source Side**: Wild mix of formats (PDFs, Excel) and structures. As noted: "Not every municipality works the same way," and there will "never" be a 1:1 match
- **Target Side**: Comuneo platform with well-structured database having specific fields and relationships (Projects, Measures, Indicators, Action Fields, and their connections)
- **AI Agent**: The bridge itself, intelligently carrying information from source to target, correctly identifying, transforming, and connecting it, even when source is messy or has unexpected information

### Updated Assessment Based on Business Context

**Our Understanding of the Goal: 900 / 1000**
Deep and accurate understanding of the true business problem. We know we are not just summarizing a PDF; we are building an intelligent onboarding assistant that can handle diverse and imperfect data sources.

**Our Current Implementation Score: 150 / 1000**
Current JSON output is still fundamentally misaligned with this goal. It is a simple summary, not the structured, relational data the platform needs.

---

## Refined Strategic Plan: How We Build the Bridge

### Phase 1: Identification & Extraction (The Four Buckets)

**Purpose**: AI reads source document (PDF or Excel) and sorts every piece of information into four main buckets: Action Fields, Projects, Measures, and Indicators.

**Key Requirement**: Must learn to recognize these items even if they are just mentioned in a sentence in a PDF or are rows in a spreadsheet.

### Phase 2: Core Schema Mapping (Building the Main Spans of the Bridge)

**Purpose**: Once items are in buckets, AI builds primary connections based on Comuneo platform's logic.

**For Every Measure, AI Must Answer:**
- Which Action Field does this belong to? 
  - Example: "Errichtung von Containergebäuden" belongs to "Soziale Gerechtigkeit & zukunftsfähige Gesellschaft"
- Which Indicator does this contribute to?
  - Example: It contributes to "Kinderarmut"
- Is it part of a Project?
  - Example: It is part of "Testproject: Equal educational chances..."

**Output**: Four clean lists of data that could be directly uploaded to platform's database.

### Phase 3: Handling the Unknown (The 'Delta' Report) - NEW CRITICAL PHASE

**Purpose**: Address what happens when source document has fields that don't exist in Comuneo (like "operational goals" or "milestones").

**Approach**: AI should not ignore this information. Instead, generate "Mapping Proposal" or "Delta Report."

**Interactive Presentation Example:**
```
I have successfully mapped 95% of the data from your document. However, I found 3 columns in your Excel sheet that I don't have a standard field for in Comuneo:

1. 'Operational Goals': Contains values like 'Errichtung von Gebäuden'.
2. 'Milestone': Contains dates and descriptions.
3. 'Budget Owner': Contains names of people.

What would you like me to do?

   Option A: Ignore this extra information.
   Option B: Create new custom fields in the platform for these items.
   Option C: Let me try to map them to existing fields (e.g., map 'Operational Goals' to the 'Beschreibung' field).
```

**Result**: AI becomes true assistant - automates 95% of tedious work and intelligently asks for guidance on remaining 5%, solving the onboarding challenge perfectly.

## Implementation Roadmap for Bridge Solution

### Immediate Technical Changes Required

1. **Redesign Core Architecture**
   - Move from nested JSON to four separate entity collections
   - Implement relationship mapping system
   - Add support for unmapped field detection

2. **Enhanced Source Document Analysis**
   - Detect document type and structure (PDF vs Excel vs other)
   - Identify municipal-specific terminology and patterns
   - Build flexible field recognition system

3. **Interactive Mapping Interface**
   - Delta report generation for unmapped fields
   - User decision workflow for handling unknowns
   - Custom field creation pipeline

4. **Platform Integration Preparation**
   - Design output format matching Comuneo database schema
   - Build validation against target platform requirements
   - Create direct upload/import functionality

This approach transforms CURATE from a simple PDF extractor into an intelligent municipal strategy onboarding assistant that handles the real-world complexity of diverse source documents.

## Recommended Solution: Two-Layer LLM Pipeline Strategy

### Assessment of the Two-Layer LLM Strategy

**Score for this Strategy: 950 / 1000**

This is a highly effective and recommended path forward that directly addresses the core problem: a single, complex task is often harder for an AI to perform well than two simpler, more focused tasks.

### Why This Strategy Excels

**1. Separation of Concerns**
Allows two specialized AIs with distinct roles:
- **LLM #1 (The Extractor)**: Only job is "dumb" but thorough extraction of all potential data from source PDF. Doesn't need to understand complex relationships, simplifying task and making it less likely to miss information.
- **LLM #2 (The Transformer)**: Only job is taking structured-but-flawed output from first LLM and intelligently cleaning, connecting, and restructuring it. Works with clean JSON, not messy PDF text, making task much easier and more reliable.

**2. Focused Prompting**
We can write much better, more specific prompt for each LLM, dramatically improving quality of final output.

**3. Error Correction**
Second LLM can be explicitly instructed to fix known errors of the first. We can tell it: "The source quotes are often wrong. Please validate them and discard any that are irrelevant." This builds self-correcting mechanism into the process.

---

## The New Strategic Plan: A Two-Layer LLM Pipeline

### Step 1: The "Extractor" LLM (Current Implementation)

**Input**: Raw PDF document text
**Task**: Extract all potential Action Fields, Projects, Measures, and Indicators into nested JSON structure. Don't worry about perfect accuracy, redundancy, or relational integrity. Just get the data out.
**Output**: The current structured JSON (treat as intermediate file)

### Step 2: The "Transformer" LLM (New Layer)

**Input**: The structured JSON from Step 1
**Task**: Read intermediate JSON and transform it into final, clean, four-bucket structure required by Comuneo

**Prompt for Transformer LLM:**
```
You will receive a JSON file that was extracted from a municipal strategy document. Your task is to convert it into four separate, interconnected lists: action_fields, projects, measures, and indicators.

Follow these rules precisely:

1. De-duplicate and Consolidate: Review all action_field strings. If you find multiple fields representing the same concept (e.g., "Quartiersentwicklung", "Siedlungs- und Quartiersentwicklung", "Attraktive Quartiere"), merge them into a single, logical category like "Quartiers- und Siedlungsentwicklung".

2. Flatten the Hierarchy: Do not nest projects inside action fields. Create four distinct, top-level lists.

3. Build the Connections: For each measure and project, analyze its context in the original structure to determine its relationships. Add a connections object to each item and link it to the appropriate items in the other lists.

4. Validate and Clean Sources: For every item, examine its sources. If a quote is clearly irrelevant, a document heading, a single word, or otherwise nonsensical, you must discard that source entirely. Only retain sources that provide direct, verifiable evidence for the item they are attached to.

The final output must be a single JSON object with four keys: action_fields, projects, measures, and indicators, each containing a clean, de-duplicated, and interconnected array of objects.
```

**Result**: By executing this second step, we can systematically resolve issues of redundancy, poor semantics, and incorrect attribution, producing final output that is truly ready for the Comuneo platform.

### Implementation Benefits

**Systematic Error Resolution:**
- Redundancy elimination through consolidation rules
- Source validation and cleaning
- Relationship mapping based on context analysis
- Semantic understanding improvement through focused processing

**Quality Assurance:**
- Each layer has single, clear responsibility
- Error correction built into pipeline design
- Output validation against target platform requirements
- Intermediate results can be inspected and debugged

**Scalability:**
- Pipeline can handle diverse document types and structures
- Each layer can be optimized independently
- Easy to add additional processing stages if needed
- Robust foundation for handling municipal variation

## Ideal JSON Structure Specification

### Design Philosophy

The ideal structure is not nested. It should be a flat, relational model, exactly like a simple database. We will have one top-level object containing four separate arrays (our "buckets"). Each item in an array will have a unique id, its own content, and a connections object that links to the ids of items in the other arrays.

### Why This Design Is Powerful

- **Avoids Data Duplication**: We define a measure once and simply refer to its ID
- **Efficient for Databases**: This structure can be loaded directly into database tables
- **Clear and Unambiguous**: The relationships are explicit

### The Exact JSON Structure

```json
{
  "action_fields": [
    {
      "id": "string (unique identifier, e.g., 'af_1')",
      "content": {
        "name": "string",
        "parent_id": "string (id of parent action_field, if any)"
      },
      "connections": {
        "project_ids": ["string (array of project ids)"],
        "measure_ids": ["string (array of measure ids)"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "string (unique identifier, e.g., 'proj_1')",
      "content": {
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string (optional)"
      },
      "connections": {
        "action_field_ids": ["string (array of action_field ids)"],
        "measure_ids": ["string (array of measure ids)"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "measures": [
    {
      "id": "string (unique identifier, e.g., 'msr_1')",
      "content": {
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string (optional)"
      },
      "connections": {
        "project_id": "string (id of the parent project, if any)",
        "action_field_ids": ["string (array of action_field ids)"],
        "indicator_ids": ["string (array of indicator ids)"]
      },
      "sources": [
        {
          "page_number": "integer",
          "quote": "string (the validated, relevant quote)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "indicators": [
    {
      "id": "string (unique identifier, e.g., 'ind_1')",
      "content": {
        "name": "string"
      },
      "connections": {
        "measure_ids": ["string (array of measure ids that contribute to this indicator)"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Concrete Example from Regensburg PDF

Here is how the first entry from the Regensburg PDF would look in this new, correct structure:

```json
{
  "action_fields": [
    {
      "id": "af_1",
      "content": {
        "name": "Siedlungs- und Quartiersentwicklung",
        "parent_id": null
      },
      "connections": {
        "project_ids": ["proj_1"],
        "measure_ids": ["msr_1", "msr_2", "msr_3"]
      }
    }
  ],

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "msr_2",
      "content": {
        "title": "Baulückenschließung",

          "page_number": 7,
          "quote": "...müssen sämtliche Potenziale der Innenentwicklung in Form von Nachverdichtung und Baulückenschließung konsequent ausgeschöpft werden."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "msr_3",
      "content": {
        "title": "Herstellung von öffentlich zugänglichen Grünflächen bei neuen Baugebieten",
        "description": ""
      },

      }
    },
    {
      "id": "ind_2",

        "name": "Erhaltung von Freiraum und fossiler Energie"
      },
      "connections": {
        "measure_ids": ["msr_3"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Final Recommended Architecture: Two-API Workflow

### Assessment of the `extract` → `file` → `enhance` Workflow

**Score for this Architecture: 1000 / 1000**

This approach is ideal because it perfectly balances the strengths of AI with the principles of good software design. It is modular, testable, and far more robust than a single, monolithic call.

Structuring the process into two distinct API calls, `extract_structure` and `enhance_structure`, is the perfect way to implement the two-layer LLM strategy. It's a clean, professional, and highly effective software architecture.

### The Final, Recommended Workflow

#### Step 1: Call `extract_structure` API

**Purpose**: To perform the initial, "dumb" extraction from the source document (the PDF). This API's only job is to get all the potentially relevant text into a structured format, even if that format is flawed.

**Input**: The source document (e.g., Regensburg_Strategie.pdf)

**Internal Action**: This API calls our "Extractor" LLM with a simple prompt focused on identifying all possible action fields, projects, measures, and indicators and putting them into the old, nested JSON structure.

**Output**: It saves the result to a file. Let's call it `intermediate_extraction.json`. The content of this file is the flawed JSON we first reviewed, with all its redundancies and incorrect attributions.

**Why This Is Smart**: This step is fast and focused. It isolates the messy work of dealing with the PDF. The output file, `intermediate_extraction.json`, now serves as a crucial checkpoint. We can look at it and see exactly what the first AI extracted before any cleaning happens.

#### Step 2: Call `enhance_structure` API

**Purpose**: To take the raw, extracted data and transform it into the clean, relational, database-ready format that the Comuneo platform requires.

**Input**: The `intermediate_extraction.json` file created in the previous step

**Internal Action**: This API calls our "Transformer" LLM. It uses the highly specific, powerful prompt we designed to:
1. De-duplicate and consolidate action fields
2. Flatten the hierarchy into the four distinct buckets
3. Build the relational connections between all items using their new unique IDs
4. Validate all sources and discard the irrelevant ones

**Output**: The final, clean JSON object, structured with the four separate, interconnected lists (action_fields, projects, measures, indicators). This is the data that gets loaded into your application.

### Summary of Benefits

This two-API approach is superior for several key reasons:

**Debugging is Easy**: If the final data is wrong, you can inspect the `intermediate_extraction.json` file. Did the first API fail to extract the data, or did the second API fail to transform it correctly? You know exactly where to look.

**Modularity and Flexibility**: You can improve or even completely replace the `extract_structure` logic later without touching the `enhance_structure` API. For example, you could build a custom Excel parser and have it output the same intermediate JSON format, and the rest of the pipeline would still work perfectly.

**Higher Quality**: By giving each LLM one focused job, you get a much better result than giving one LLM a single, highly complex job.

### Implementation Architecture
