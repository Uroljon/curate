# Graph-Based Streaming Extraction Architecture for CURATE

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a complete architectural redesign of CURATE's PDF extraction system, implementing a graph-based streaming extraction pipeline with multi-agent orchestration, template learning, and progressive enhancement. This architecture fundamentally reimagines document processing as building a living knowledge graph rather than extracting isolated chunks.

## System Overview

The new architecture processes German municipal strategy documents through a sophisticated pipeline that constructs a knowledge graph in real-time as it streams through the document. Unlike traditional extraction methods that process chunks independently, this system maintains full document context, learns from previous extractions, and prevents information duplication through intelligent graph construction.

### Core Philosophy

Documents are not collections of independent text chunks but interconnected networks of concepts, relationships, and hierarchies. Our architecture treats each document as a potential knowledge graph where:

- Action fields connect to multiple projects
- Projects contain various measures
- Measures link to specific indicators
- Indicators reference temporal targets and baselines
- All entities maintain bidirectional relationships

## Architecture Components

### 1. Document Intelligence Layer

#### Document Structure Analyzer
The first component that touches any PDF, operating without LLM assistance to maximize speed and minimize cost. It performs deep structural analysis through:

- **Hierarchical Pattern Recognition**: Identifies German municipal document patterns including numbered sections (1.1, 1.2.1), heading styles, and table of contents structures
- **Layout Analysis**: Detects multi-column layouts, tables, figures, and their relationships to surrounding text
- **Template Fingerprinting**: Creates unique document signatures based on structural patterns, enabling rapid template matching
- **Language and Domain Detection**: Identifies not just German language but specific municipal terminology patterns

#### Visual Layout Processor
Leverages computer vision techniques to understand document structure beyond text:

- **Region Detection**: Identifies headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas
- **Table Structure Recognition**: Extracts complex tables maintaining cell relationships
- **Figure-Text Association**: Links charts and diagrams to their textual descriptions
- **Spatial Relationship Mapping**: Understands which text elements belong together based on visual proximity

### 2. Knowledge Graph Core

#### Dynamic Graph Engine
The central nervous system of the architecture, maintaining a living representation of extracted knowledge:

- **Multi-Model Graph Structure**: Supports property graphs, RDF triples, and hypergraphs simultaneously
- **Embedding-Powered Nodes**: Each node contains both structured data and dense vector embeddings
- **Confidence-Weighted Edges**: Relationships carry confidence scores and provenance information
- **Temporal Versioning**: Tracks how entities and relationships evolve through the document

#### Semantic Deduplication Engine
Prevents duplicate information at the point of entry rather than post-processing:

- **Multi-Level Similarity Detection**: Operates at syntactic, semantic, and conceptual levels
- **Context-Aware Thresholds**: Adjusts similarity thresholds based on entity type and document section
- **Merge Strategies**: Implements sophisticated merging rules that preserve maximum information
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles contradictory information through confidence scoring and source tracking

### 3. Streaming Processing Pipeline

#### Stateful Stream Processor
Maintains extraction state as it processes the document linearly:

- **Sliding Context Windows**: Maintains overlapping windows of configurable size (typically 3-5 chunks)
- **State Machine Management**: Tracks current extraction context (in measures section, reading indicators, etc.)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Builds understanding incrementally, refining earlier extractions with later context
- **Checkpoint System**: Creates restoration points for error recovery and parallel processing

#### Adaptive Chunking System
Intelligently segments documents based on content rather than arbitrary boundaries:

- **Semantic Boundary Detection**: Identifies natural breaking points in German text
- **Dynamic Chunk Sizing**: Adjusts chunk size based on content density and LLM context windows
- **Cross-Reference Preservation**: Ensures references ("siehe Abschnitt 3.2") maintain connectivity
- **Table and List Handling**: Keeps structured elements intact within chunks

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer

#### Agent Coordination Framework
Manages a team of specialized extraction agents working in concert:

- **Message Bus Architecture**: Enables asynchronous communication between agents

- Maps dependencies and prerequisites

**Indicator Specialist Agent**
- Focuses exclusively on KPIs and measurement criteria
- Understands baseline vs. target values
- Links indicators to responsible parties and deadlines

**Validation and Consistency Agent**
- Performs cross-validation of extracted information
- Ensures logical consistency across the graph
- Identifies missing or suspicious data

### 5. Template Learning System

#### Pattern Recognition Engine
Learns from successful extractions to improve future performance:

- **Structural Pattern Library**: Stores successful extraction patterns for different document types

## Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Document Ingestion and Analysis

The system begins by accepting a PDF through the ingestion API. The Document Structure Analyzer performs a rapid scan without LLM assistance, creating a structural map of the document. This includes identifying major sections, detecting the document template, and creating a processing plan.

Simultaneously, the Visual Layout Processor analyzes the PDF's visual structure, identifying tables, figures, and layout patterns that inform the extraction strategy. The system creates a document fingerprint and searches the Template Library for similar previously processed documents.

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning

Based on the structural analysis and template matching results, the Adaptive Strategy Selection component creates an extraction plan. This plan determines:

- Which agents to deploy for which sections
- Optimal chunk sizing for different document parts
- Confidence thresholds for deduplication
- Expected extraction patterns based on similar documents

### Phase 3: Streaming Extraction

The document enters the Streaming Processing Pipeline, where the Stateful Stream Processor begins sequential processing. As each chunk is processed:

1. The Adaptive Chunking System creates semantically meaningful segments
2. The Agent Coordination Framework routes chunks to appropriate specialist agents
3. Multiple agents may process the same chunk from different perspectives
4. Results are immediately integrated into the growing Knowledge Graph

The system maintains a sliding window of context, allowing later chunks to refine earlier extractions. The State Machine tracks progress through the document, adjusting extraction strategies based on current location.

### Phase 4: Progressive Enhancement

As the Knowledge Graph grows, several enhancement processes run continuously:

- The Semantic Deduplication Engine merges similar entities
- The Relationship Mapping Agent identifies new connections
- The Validation Agent ensures consistency across the graph
- Confidence scores are continuously updated based on new evidence

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance

Once initial extraction completes, the Quality Assurance Pipeline performs comprehensive validation:

- Schema compliance verification
- Logical consistency checking
- Completeness analysis against expected patterns
- Cross-reference resolution

Low-confidence extractions are flagged for potential human review, with specific guidance on what requires attention.

### Phase 6: Learning and Adaptation

After successful extraction, the Template Learning System:

- Records successful extraction patterns
- Updates the pattern library with new insights
- Adjusts confidence thresholds based on outcomes
- Refines agent strategies for future documents

## Technical Infrastructure Requirements
